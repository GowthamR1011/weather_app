## Project Motivation and Goals

This project is a personal initiative to build a dynamic Weather Application using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, aimed at sharpening my JavaScript and web development skills. The app will allow users to search for current weather conditions and view real-time updates such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed for any location. It will also feature location-based weather updates using geolocation and provide a 5-day or hourly forecast. Leveraging Next.js, the app will incorporate features like server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for optimal performance and SEO-friendliness, while Tailwind CSS will ensure a sleek, responsive design with utility-first styling.

Through this project, I aim to deepen my understanding of API integration, responsive design principles, and modern web development workflows. It will include additional features like a toggleable dark mode for better user experience and reusable UI components for scalability. This Weather App serves as both a learning opportunity and a portfolio piece to showcase my ability to create practical, visually appealing, and user-friendly applications with cutting-edge tools.
